Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\nNotion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).",

So, we're creating the first-of-its-kind food experience that puts people (and the planet) first, built for busy lives and individual needs.\nWe are a distributed team built on top talent from across the U.S. While we have an office in NYC, we support employees creating \"offices\" wherever they are. We believe in fostering team connection and collaboration across all of our \"offices\" - so don't expect to be online at 6 am to make a meeting if you're on the West coast. Expect to attend regular team building events, and to be able to work from the beach every once in a while. Expect to be treated like an owner who cares about our common goal, not someone who has to clock in and out of work.",

So, we're creating the first-of-its-kind food experience that puts people (and the planet) first, built for busy lives and individual needs.\nWe are a distributed team built on top talent from across the U.S. While we have an office in NYC, we support employees creating \"offices\" wherever they are. We believe in fostering team connection and collaboration across all of our \"offices\" - so don't expect to be online at 6 am to make a meeting if you're on the West coast. Expect to attend regular team building events, and to be able to work from the beach every once in a while. Expect to be treated like an owner who cares about our common goal, not someone who has to clock in and out of work.",
